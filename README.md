# Data Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains three main projects showcasing my data engineering skills: ETL, Web Scraping and Data Extraction, and SQLite Database Operations.

## Projects

### 1. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

This project demonstrates the ETL process which involves extracting data from various file formats, transforming the data, and loading it into a target file.

**Features:**
- Extract data from CSV, JSON, and XML files.
- Transform data by converting units.
- Load data into a CSV file.
- Log each phase of the ETL process.

**Usage:**
- Run `data_extraction.py` to execute the ETL process.

### 2. Web Scraping and Data Extraction

This project involves scraping data from a web page, parsing the HTML to extract specific data points, and storing the extracted data in both CSV and SQLite database formats.

**Features:**
- Scrape data from a specified URL.
- Parse HTML content to extract table data.
- Save extracted data to a CSV file and an SQLite database.

**Usage:**
- Run `webscraping.py` to perform web scraping and data extraction.

### 3. SQLite Database Operations

This project demonstrates various database operations using SQLite, including creating tables, inserting data, and querying the database.

**Features:**
- Read data from CSV files.
- Create and populate SQLite tables.
- Perform SQL queries and operations on the database.
- Append new data to tables.

**Usage:**
- Run `sqlite_operations.py` to perform database operations.
